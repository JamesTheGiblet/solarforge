# âœ¨ Features

The **Solar System Asteroid Monitor** is packed with features to provide an immersive and educational experience.

### ðŸŒŸ Core Visualization

- **3D Solar System Model**: An accurate 3D representation of the Sun and all 8 planets.
- **Real-time Orbital Mechanics**: Planets follow realistic orbits, and their positions are updated in real-time based on the simulation clock.
- **Asteroid Belt**: A visually impressive particle-based representation of the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter.
- **Named Asteroids**: Includes major asteroids like Ceres, Vesta, and Pallas, as well as potentially hazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) like Apophis.
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Planet sizes can be adjusted dynamically for better visibility and comparison.

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Controls

- **Full Camera Control**: Easily zoom, rotate, and tilt the camera to get the perfect viewing angle.
- **Time Manipulation**: Speed up, slow down, or pause the flow of time to observe orbital patterns.
- **View Presets**: Instantly jump to pre-configured views of the inner planets, the asteroid belt, or the outer solar system.
- **Object Selection**: Click or tap any celestial body to bring up a detailed information panel.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find any planet or named asteroid in the simulation.

### ðŸ”¬ Scientific Features

- **Collision Detection**: A real-time proximity warning system highlights asteroids that are on a close approach trajectory with a planet.
- **Gravity Spheres (Sphere of Influence)**: Visualize the region around each planet where its gravitational pull is dominant.
- **Orbital Path Visualization**: Toggleable lines show the orbital paths of all planets and major asteroids.
- **Accurate Data**: The simulation is built upon real astronomical data for orbital periods, distances, and sizes from sources like NASA.

### ðŸ“± User Experience

- **Responsive Design**: The interface and visualization adapt gracefully to both desktop and mobile screen sizes.
- **Intuitive Touch Controls**: Full support for touch gestures on mobile devices, including pinch-to-zoom and drag-to-rotate.
- **Helpful Keyboard Shortcuts**: Power users can navigate and control the simulation efficiently using keyboard commands.
- **Performance Optimization**: The application is tuned for performance, with adaptive detail levels to ensure smooth rendering on a wide range of devices.
